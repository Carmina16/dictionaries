# Occidental Dictionaries

This repository is an effort to liberate Occidental dictionary data from walled gardens.

Slowly but surely, we are gathering dictionary data from various sources and translating them to the open and free format of CSV.

If you'd like to create an HTML table, JSON file, or Excel sheet, just download the CSV and convert from there.

## Contributing
